## My Favorite Things Written

    Hi My name is Ishan Sharma. I am a first year UX student but a Second Year Uni student here at Laurier. My favorite thing I have written was a poem about how much I love my parents. 
    I made the poem when I was younger because it was meant to be a class project and I put my small heart out into that because I wanted to show my parents how much I love them. 

    It went something like: "I love you, You love me, We are a big family, From East to West, My parents are the Best". I remember it because before this I had never made a poem for my parents and this one meant the most. I still remember the look on their faces filled with joy because they have never seen me do something like that for them.
